Over The Light is my personal project for home automation system that allows you to communicate with smart devices (sonoff) at home safely. The system automatically detects connected devices at home and adds them to the server to allow them to be controlled from the Android app or Wear OS app.

> Attention: this project is under construction. The android app, or the server may not be work as expected. Need help or questions? [contact me :)](https://www.t.me/Xiryl)

## Why Reinventing the Wheel?
<img src="https://github.com/Xiryl/OTL/blob/master/ot/giphy.gif" />

**dafaq is this repo?** _why am I reinventing the wheel?_

Who has never wanted to try some smart IoT devices in their home? I am among these. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**The problem:** the official app for this stuff, eWeLink, has several security problems. 
- security concerns (clear HTTP traffic to China ü§îü§î )
- terrible UI/UX
- lack of features

**My solution:** build my own home automation system. 

> _Smarter. More secure. **Sexier.**_

OTL offers:
- jwt + simmetric key + IP whitelist and authentication checks
- supports all devices on mqtt protocol
- group IoT devices _by topic_
- single or grouped device control
- timers, actions and schedulers
- available on telegram, android, web and Postman (if you love raw requests üòèüòè)
- full customization (block specific commands, APIs, devices, topics)
- compatible with Google Assistant and Alexa
- better logs
- obviusly, sexy UI

## Installation
To run the entire project you need:
- An instance of MQTT broker server
- For shell testing, MQTT phao/mosquitto
- Modify the `config.json` file accordingly
- Patience

```JSON
{
    "MQTT": {
        "MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS" : "mqtt://127.0.16.1",

Then `npm install` and `node server.js`

## Android
Open the project with Android Studio.

The app UI should look like these (_I only post login UI, but the rest of the app is sexy too with animation and transition_):

## Auth and API call workflow

The authentication system uses jwt + key + client IP. You can open a larger version of the image [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xiryl/OTL/master/ot/api_diagram.png?raw=true)

## System Workflow Connection

When a new device req. connection call this workflow. You can open a larger version of the image [HERE](https://github.com/Xiryl/OTL/blob/master/ot/devices_diagram.png?raw=true)

## Project Structure
Each folder of the repo represents a component

- `droid`
  - Android app
  - Wear OS
- `controller`
  - all the components for back-end
    - `server.js` contains API handler
    - `controller.js` contains MQTT handler
